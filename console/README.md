# Console

The console is the command-line interface for managing and controlling Flipper.

## Installation

Installing the console requires [the rust build setup](https://rustup.rs/).

```
cd console/
cargo install
```

## Usage

### Booting

This currently just wraps `dfu-programmer` and executes the correct command to
boot up Flipper, so it requires that you have `dfu-programmer` installed. In
the future we will probably bundle or implement it ourselves to eliminate that
dependency.

```
flipper boot
```

### Flashing

Flashing is the process of completely rewriting the firmware on Flipper's main
processor. This is used to update Flipper's OS, but can also be used to flash
bare metal ARM code.

```
flipper flash <firmware>
```

Where `firmware` is the path to the binary to flash.

### Generating bindings

Bindings are generated by reading a package binary file. Currently the only
bindings that work are for C.

```
flipper generate <module binary> <module name>
```

## Planned functionality

* Create and manage Flipper packages (similar to  cargo or npm)
* Command-line control of built-in packages (usart, spi, i2c, pwm, etc.)
* Generate high level language bindings for packages
