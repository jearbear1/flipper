Package
===

This example demonstrates the structure necessary to build a package that encapsulates a module as well as the C bindings and test program needed to communicate with the module from the host.

**For the sake of naming disambiguation, the following names have been giving to the subcomponents of this package.**

- **qux** - the device module
- **quxc** - the C bindings to the module
- **quxtest** - the test application
